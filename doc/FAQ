Q. Is there a command line version?
A. Yes, you can download the tarball and cd to
   the fslint directory, and use it directly from there.
   Note the GUI just wraps these command line programs,
   so alternatively you can cd or add to $PATH the
   /usr/share/fslint/fslint directory on a standard install.

Q. Can I download the tarball and hack & run the GUI
   without installing it?
A. Yes, just run ./fslint-gui from the directory you extract
   and it automatically notices this and uses just the
   files in the extracted directory. Note you will need
   to do a make in the po directory for i18n to work.

Q. Where's the Makefile? How do I build/install it from source?
A. It's python so nothing needs to be built on the target.
   There's no Makefile to [un]install because there's no need (see previous FAQ)
   To build an rpm just tar.gz the working directory to fslint-x.xx.tar.gz.
   For example: tar czf fslint-2.17.tar.gz --exclude=.svn fslint
   and then: rpmbuild -ta fslint-x.xx.tar.gz. Alternatively
   to build a deb just cp -a the working directory to fslint-x.xx
   and then: cd fslint-x.xx && dpkg-buildpackage -I.svn -rfakeroot -tc

Q. The released RPM doesn't install on mandriva or SuSE?
A. Unfortunately Mandriva and SuSE at least use different
   pygtk package names to fedora/redhat.
   FSlint does support automatically building the correct package
   on the mandriva and suse platforms. To build a package for these
   distros, just get the release tar.gz and as in the previous FAQ:
       sudo rpmbuild -ta fslint-x.xx.tar.gz

Q. In "Advanced Search Parameters"->"Paths to exclude",
   how do I exclude directories &/or files matching a pattern
   rather than a specific file or directory?
A. To exclude all txt files add a path of /*txt
   To exclude all CVS dirs  add a path of /*CVS

Q. How do I navigate the file lists with the keyboard?
A. FSlint uses a GtkCList in "multiple selection" mode throughout.

   1. Ctrl + up, down to scroll the list.
   2. up, down, PgUp, PgDown, Ctrl+home and Ctrl+end to change selected item.
   3. Shift + the movement keys extends a contiguous selection.
   4. Ctrl + space, toggles the discontiguous selection mode.
   When in this mode, one can navigate to any row using the movement keys
   and space will toggle that row's selection state. Also holding Shift
   while using the movement keys will extend the selection.

   For completeness the mouse works like:

   1. Clicking an item selects it.
   2. Ctrl+click adds toggles rows to and from a discontiguous selection.
   3. Dragging the mouse over rows makes a contiguous selection.
   4. Shift+click extends a contiguous selection to the clicked row.
