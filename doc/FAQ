Q. Is there a command line version?
A. Yes, you can download the tarball and cd to
   the fslint directory, and use it directly from there.
   Note the GUI just wraps these command line programs,
   so alternatively you can cd or add to $PATH the
   /usr/share/fslint/fslint directory on a standard install.

Q. Can I download the tarball and hack & run the GUI
   without installing it?
A. Yes, just run ./fslint-gui from the directory you extract
   and it automatically notices this and uses just the
   files in the extracted directory. Note you will need
   to do a make in the po directory for i18n to work.

Q. Where's the Makefile? How do I build/install it from source?
A. It's python so nothing needs to be built on the target.
   There's no Makefile to [un]install because there's no need (see previous FAQ)
   To build an rpm just tar.gz the working directory to fslint-x.xx.tar.gz
   and then: rpmbuild -ta fslint-x.xx.tar.gz. Alternatively
   to build a deb just cp -a the working directory to fslint-x.xx
   and then: cd fslint-x.xx && dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -tc

Q. The released RPM doesn't install on mandrake or mandriva?
A. Mandrake in their wisdom decided to use different pygtk package
   names to everyone else. Now there is support for automatically
   building the correct package on the mandriva platform, I just
   don't release the mandriva specific RPM. To build the mandriva
   specific RPM just get the release tar.gz and as in the previous FAQ:
       sudo rpmbuild -ta fslint-x.xx.tar.gz

Q. In "Advanced Search Parameters"->"Paths to exclude",
   how do I exclude directories &/or files matching a pattern
   rather than a specific file or directory?
A. To exclude all txt files add a path of /*txt
   To exclude all CVS dirs  add a path of /*CVS

Q. How do I navigate the file lists with the keyboard?
A. FSlint uses a GtkCList in "multiple selection" mode throughout.

   1. General list movement keys are, up, down, Ctrl+home and Ctrl+end
   2. Shift + the movement keys extends a contiguous selection.
   3. Ctrl + space, toggles the discontiguous selection mode. When in
   this mode, one can navigate to any row using the movement keys (1)
   and space will toggle that row's selection state.

   For completeness the mouse works like:

   1. Clicking an item selects it.
   2. Ctrl+click adds toggles rows to and from a discontiguous selection.
   3. Draging mouse over rows makes a contiguous selection.
   4. Shift+click extends a contiguous selection to the clicked row.
